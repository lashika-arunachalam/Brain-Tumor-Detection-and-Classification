# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classification

In multiple healthcare evaluation applications, autonomous flaw identification in medical imaging has emerged as a new field. Because of the intricacy and variety of tumors that have not yet been thoroughly characterized, detecting brain tumors is a challenging task. We are currently seeing a significant increase in brain tumor cases. In order to recognize separate tumors from the MRI pictures, developed an automated system. The three-part strategy consists of applying pre-processing techniques to brain magnetic resonance imaging scans, extracting features via Otsu binarization and the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and segmenting the results with K means clustering. Next, identification is performed by the machine learning approach SVM. A dataset of 150 MRI pictures was used for testing the suggested approach. This collection included 30 photographs of a healthy brain, a total of 60 malignant tumors, and 50 MRIs of benign tumors. The findings demonstrate that the suggested approach is capable of correctly recognizing and categorizing carcinomas of the brain, making it a valuable tool for medical practitioners in the detection and management of brain tumors. The suggested approach can also help surgeons diagnose brain tumors more accurately and quickly by speeding up analysis.
